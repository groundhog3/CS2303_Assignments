# CS2303_Assignments

This repository  contains all the code written for my Systems Programming (CS2303) class at WPI. 
All programs are written for a UNIX environment and instructions on how to compile and run them are attached in each program's individual readme.

# Homework 1

For this assignment 3 programs were developed.
1. `num` – This program takes in only one number and returns it.
2. `grades` – This program takes in a list of grades (max 20) and returns the mean, min, and max of the grades.
3. `leap` – This program takes in a year and determines if it's a leap year or common year.

# Homework 2

For this assignment three programs were created:
1. `at` – This program demonstrates fixed size integer arrays in C.
2. `at2` – This program takes in an array of doubles from the command line, prints them, sorts them, and prints them out again.
3. `at3` – This program generates an array of random integers, prints them, sorts them, and prints them out again.

# Homework 3

For this assignment, 2 testers were created:

1. `ctest` – this tests the functionality of functions from "mystring.h"
2. `student_test` - This tests functionality of the student struct.

# Homework 4

For this assignment, 2 programs were created.

1. `sorttest` – This program takes in numbers from the command line, puts them into an array, sorts them, and prints out time taken to sort.
2. `sorttest2` – This program does much of the same as sorrtest except it uses randomly generated values and lets user select sorting function.

# Homework 5

This assignment tests creating dynamic-sized stacks and reading input from the keyboard.
In total 4 programs were created:
1. `./stacktest` This takes x num strings, pushes them into a stack, and then pops them off.
2. `./stacktest_dbg` Same as `./stacktest` with debugging tools.
3. `./stacktest2` This takes x num strings, prints each string in reverse order.
4. `./stacktest2_dbg` Same as `./stacktest2` with debugging tools.

# Homework 6

For this assignment, 2 programs were created.
1. `fed2cs2303`: this program was finished in lab06 and parses a CSV from federal govt.
2. `zipcode`: this program reads csv created by `fed2cs2303` and allows user to filter data from it.
