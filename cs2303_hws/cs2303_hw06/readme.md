# CS2303_HW06

For this assignment, 2 programs were created.
1. `fed2cs2303`: this program was finished in lab06 and parses a CSV from federal govt.
2. `zipcode`: this program reads csv created by `fed2cs2303` and allows user to filter data from it.

# Compilation 
To compile the program, open the directory into any unix environment and enter make to compile all the source files.
```sh
$ cd <path to directory>/cs2303_hw06
~/<path to directory>/cs2303_hw06$ make
```
**Note**: To compile individual testers enter `make fed2cs2303` or `make zipcode`.

To get doxygen output, configure the target folder in the makefile and enter make docs.
```sh
$ make docs
```

To remove object files and executables, run this command:
```sh
$ make clean
```
